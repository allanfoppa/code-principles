# Meaningful Names

## Overview

One of the most fundamental principles of clean code is using meaningful, descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and modules.

## Key Rules

### 1. Use Intention-Revealing Names

- Names should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it's used
- Avoid cryptic abbreviations and single-letter variables

### 2. Avoid Disinformation

- Don't use names that vary in small ways
- Avoid using words that have entrenched meanings

### 3. Make Meaningful Distinctions

- Don't use number series naming (data1, data2)
- Avoid noise words (ProductInfo vs Product)

### 4. Use Pronounceable Names

- Names should be easy to discuss with teammates

### 5. Use Searchable Names

- Single-letter names and numeric constants are hard to locate
- Length of a name should correspond to the size of its scope

### 6. Class Names

- Classes should have noun or noun phrase names
- Avoid words like Manager, Processor, Data, Info

### 7. Method Names

- Methods should have verb or verb phrase names
- Accessors, mutators, and predicates should be named for their value

## NOTE

"The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used."
