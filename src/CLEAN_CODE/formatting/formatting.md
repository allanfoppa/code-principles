# Formatting

## Overview

Code formatting makes code easier to read and understand. Consistent formatting throughout a codebase is essential for maintainability and team collaboration.

## Key Rules

### 1. Vertical Formatting

#### File Size

- Keep files small (ideally under 500 lines)
- Large files are harder to understand and maintain

#### Vertical Openness

- Use blank lines to separate concepts
- Group related code together

#### Vertical Density

- Lines of code that are tightly related should appear vertically close

#### Vertical Distance

- Variables should be declared close to their usage
- Related functions should be close to each other

### 2. Horizontal Formatting

#### Line Length

- Keep lines reasonably short (80-120 characters)
- Long lines are hard to read

#### Horizontal Openness and Density

- Use horizontal white space to associate related things
- Use spaces around operators and after commas

#### Indentation

- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)
- Indentation shows the hierarchy of scopes

### 3. Team Rules

- Every team member should follow the same formatting rules
- Use automated formatting tools (Prettier, ESLint)
- The team's formatting rules take precedence over personal preferences

### 4. Consistent Structure

- Organize imports logically
- Group similar functions together
- Follow consistent ordering (public before private, etc.)

## NOTE

"Code formatting is about communication, and communication is the professional developer's first order of business."
